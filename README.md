# Marfeyx Games

Welcome to the unofficial, entirely serious documentation for the Marfeyx Games static site. Everything here is 100% factual unless you read it twice.

## What This Project Pretends To Be
- A handcrafted portal for showcasing games, experiments, and the occasional misplaced 404 page.
- A design playground with floating orbs, glassmorphism, and buttons that definitely toggle something.
- A living style guide for header/nav/footer layouts that refuse to break on mobile (most days).

## Internationalization
- Language toggle exists. It currently switches between “Hope” and “Dreams.” Actual translations pending vibes.

## Theme Support
- Dark and light themes are provided. The toggle moon icon is legally obligated to appear whimsical.

## FAQ
- **Q:** Why are there so many orbs? **A:** Because squares were taken.
- **Q:** Is this responsive? **A:** Yes, in the emotional sense.
- **Q:** Does the level generator work? **A:** Absolutely, as long as you do not run it.
